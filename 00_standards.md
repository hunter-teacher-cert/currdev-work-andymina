# Assignment 00

## Course Information

_Course name_: Computer Vision
_Grade level_: 12th
_Pre-requisites_: Calculus
_Standards targeted_:

- 9-12.CT.4: Implement a program using a combination of student-defined
  and third-party functions to organize the computation.
- 9-12.CT.7: Design or remix a program that utilizes a data structure to
  maintain changes to related pieces of data.
- 9-12.CT.8: Develop a program that effectively uses control structure in
  order to create a computer program for pratical intent, personal
  expression, or to address a societal issue.
- 9-12.CT.9: Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test
  cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.
- 9-12.CT.10: Collaboratively design and develop a program or
  computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation
  outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.
- 9-12.NSD.1: Design a solution to a problem that utilizes embedded
  systems to automatically gather input from the environment.

In this course, students will gain a deeper understanding of how computers
receive, process, and manipulate input "visual data." Students will create
their own implementations of modern computer vision algorithms used in
widely popular technologies and tools such as blurring an image, extracting
the average "color(s)" from an image, and basic object detection. At the
end of the course, students will be required to research and write a brief
report explaining recent work in an area of interest within the computer
vision field. After this course, students will walk away with a deeper
understanding of how computer vision technology permeates the world around
them and a portfolio of projects to further prove their findings.
The main topics for this course are:

- Introduction to Matrix Algebra
- How human vision works
- Extracting data from binary images
- Convolutions as image filters and data extraction
- Shape detection algorithms:
  - Sobel operator for edges
  - Canny Hough fitting/Hough transform
- Processing stereo images, shape from structure
- Structure from motion
- AI/ML hot topics: convolutional neural networks, object/face recognition

## Motivation

I personally find the field of computer vision extremely interesting. I
find it fascinating that many of us take the tools we use daily for
granted. Even the process of taking an image is so unbelievably complex
and I would love for students to develop a deeper appreciation for
commonly used tools like Photoshop for image editing and DALL-E for
image generation by understanding the fundamentals and beginning of
computer vision.

As I've mentioned before, I have some CS education experience, mainly in
teaching web development. I'd like to steer away from web development as a
potential course to try something new and continue building my teaching
portfolio. I have a great deal of web-dev experience myself so creating
a computer vision class would further my current understanding more since
I'd have to be able to break the information down into student sized
chunks.
