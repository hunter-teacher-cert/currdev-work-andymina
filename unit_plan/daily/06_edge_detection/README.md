# 06_edge_detection

Students are introduced to the basic theory of edge detector which uses a combination of convolution and derivatives to measure the rate of change in pixel intensity/brightness in a small region. In this lesson, students derive the Prewitt edge detector from their knowledge about the block blur kernel.
