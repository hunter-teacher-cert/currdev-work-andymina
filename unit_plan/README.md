# Unit Plan Project - Andy Mina

**Course**: Introduction to Computer Vision

**Grade level**: 11-12th grade

**Unit**: Convolution and Edge Detection

## Course background

The "Introduction to Computer Vision" course is a course offered to students who have already taken AP Computer Science A in Java. 

## General Overview

This 

Students learn what convolution is and how it can be used to extract data, derive information, and modify images.

Prior to this course, students should:

- have some familiarity with calculus
- be experienced with the Python programming language
- have taken an introductory computer science course

Prior to this unit, students should:

- be familiar with numpy for working with large 2D arrays
- 2D arrays as representations of images in code
- know how to convert color images to grayscale

There are four main principles to this unit:
1. The slides function as notes
  - Students should not need to take notes but instead can go through the slides again. The slides
    are descriptive and visual enough to refer back to and self-teach the lesson
2. We spend a lot of time on difficult concepts and theories.
  - Lessons that involve a lot of theory or complex theory focus almost entirely on the theory. By the
    time the lesson is over, students should have some understanding of how these complex systems work. After
    class, they are expected to work on code that translates a portion of the theory they've learned into
    practice.
3. Discovery-based learning
  - Students are most engaged and least confused when they can personally reach the same conclusions
    that famous computer scientists did. The unit is delivered in a way where students discover new
    solutions and techniques by transformative processes vs. an instructor just brain-dumping in a 45m
    long lecture

## Motivation for Unit

(why have you decided to make this?)

i like computer vision and i think it would cool to teach to high schoolers. the subject matter
is difficult, but a great challenge for me as an educator to make this content digestable for high
schoolers.

## Standards Referenced

List The NY State Computer Science standards you will be covering in this unit. Provide the number and name (e.g. 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Modeling and Simulation)

---

## Tools Used

(include programming language(s), specific programs/environments, and other tools (digital or otherwise) if necessary)

- Python: simple language and easy to abstract
- Numpy: great tool for working with large 2d arrays
- matplotlib: for displaying images, graphs, and diagrams
- jupyter notebook: for note-taking and code alongs
