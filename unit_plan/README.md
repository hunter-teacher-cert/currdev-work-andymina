# Unit Plan Project - Andy Mina

**Course**: Introduction to Computer Vision

**Unit**: Convolutions

## General Overview

(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)

Students learn what convolution is and how it can be used to extract data, derive information, and modify images.

Prior to this course, students should:

- have some familiarity with calculus
- be experienced with the Python programming language
- have taken an introductory computer science course

Prior to this unit, students should:

- be familiar with numpy for working with large 2d arrays
- 2d arrays as representation of image in code
- know how to convert color images to grayscale

---

## Motivation for Unit

(why have you decided to make this?)

i like computer vision and i think it would cool to teach to high schoolers. the subject matter
is difficult, but a great challenge for me as an educator to make this content digestable for high
schoolers.

## Standards Referenced

List The NY State Computer Science standards you will be covering in this unit. Provide the number and name (e.g. 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Modeling and Simulation)

---

## Tools Used

(include programming language(s), specific programs/environments, and other tools (digital or otherwise) if necessary)

- Python: simple language and easy to abstract
- Numpy: great tool for working with large 2d arrays
- matplotlib: for displaying images, graphs, and diagrams
- jupyter notebook: for note-taking and code alongs
