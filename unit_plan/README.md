## Lessons

Total length: 2 Weeks

## Week 1 - Understanding Convolutions

- **00_intro**: introduction to convolutions and how they're used
- **01_lab**: guided practice applying convolutions to grayscale images
- **02_blur**: introduce blurring convolution and practice blurring images
- **03_sharpen**: introduce sharpening convolution and practice sharpening images
- **04_presentation**: (small groups) mini-presentation (< 5m) about something convolution related

## Week 2 - Programming Convolutions

- **05_creating_convolutions**: (small groups) practice applying their own convolutions to grayscale images
- **06_color_convolutions**: color conversion from RGB -> grayscale to perform convolutions on color images
- **07_sobel**: introduction to sobel convolution filter
- **08_edge_detection**: guided practice using sobel edge detection
- **09_project**: sobel edge detection in-class project
