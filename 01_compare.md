# Curriculum Comparison (PLTW vs. BJC)

For this week's assignment I chose to compare Project Lead the Way (PLTW) and Beauty and Joy of
Computing (BJC). A few years back I had volunteered with TEALs and the AP CS P teacher I was working
under used the BJC curriculum. One of the biggest difference between PLTW and BJC is that PLTW
doesn't rely on any specific language or tool whereas BJC is completely reliant on Snap. I
definitely think that there are circumstances where one curriculum could be better suited than the
other but I have a personal aversion to Scratch, Snap, and the rest of block-based programming
languages. I personally feel that these paradigms eclipse the computational mindset and students
mainly focus on putting the right blocks together rather than understading what those block represent.
Through the sole use of Scratch, Snap, and others, I think many students can fall into a pit where
they can only interact with Computer Science through the lens of block-based paradigms; text-based
programming becomes immediately overwhelming due to a lack of familiarity. To me, block-based
programming paradigms are akin to teaching children how to sight-read instead of phonetics.

The biggest similarity between each of the curricula is that they have nearly the same structure
before the AP Create Task. Before this point in the course, both curricula have the following
unit focuses: algorithms, abstraction, how the internet works, processing/maintaing data,
and simulations.

Both curricula seem to cover the shared units in about the same depth. However, it is worth noting
that after the AP Create Task, PLTW chooses to push students toward the modern applications of
Computer Science by having them design simulations and learn about ML/AI whereas BJC pushes students
to gain a deeper understanding of programming gearing students toward a collegiate Computer Science
education.
